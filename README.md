# Sports Trivia Game!
___

For this project, we were asked to create a basic, themed trivia quiz, based on a theme, that would allow interactivity with the user, include a countdown timer, radio buttons (or only allowing the user to select one answer), and have the results shown whether the user clicks on the submit button, or the timer runs out.  The thought process for this game was to layout and pseudo-code the layout of the page, and the necessary variables, functions and other aspects that I would need to complete it.  Then, I chose a sports themed quiz with a simple HTML form layout with radio buttons for answer choices, and cooresponding CSS to match the aesthetics I was looking for.  Also, buttons were added so that there was the ability for the user to 'start' the quiz, 'submit' their answers, and 'restart' the game.  Lastly, the JavaScript code was written and linked to add and aid in the interactivity of the quiz.

Using HTML and CSS, I was able to create the feel of the quiz, and then coded out the rest of the project from there in JavaScript.  The few rough patches I hit with this project was initially collecting the values from the radio buttons, and then having the correct score (and in the right format) show up once the time ran out or the user submitted their answers.  Some help came from sites like StackOverflow, but collecting values from radio buttons were able to be done in various ways, so the most help I had was sitting down with Bryan and Aaron.  From the other activities and projects that I've worked on and completed filled in the remaining help needed to complete the adding in of the timer and other buttons.  One last tough part of the coding of this project was sometimes mixing up JavaScript and jQuery code on my .js page.  In the future, I will keep in mind both aspects of JavaScript and jQuery to keep pages loading faster, and to keep the code uniform.
